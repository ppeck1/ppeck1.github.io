This wiki is generated from current Coheronia repo data and includes live, internal, and planned-data references. Planned-data pages are not live gameplay unless marked as live.

## Fresh HUD and inventory evidence

The 2026-07-17 deterministic capture tour refreshed the public screenshot set. `03_inventory.png` shows the live **I** inventory board (loadout, carried backpack, item detail, sort control, and five-slot dock); `10_vessel_damage_states.png` proves that the native health and attunement vessels drain independently while the HUD's runtime labels, icons, counts, hotkeys, and actions remain live. The gameplay video linked from the README predates this HUD and inventory board, so use these screenshots—not the video UI—as the current interface reference.

## Purpose

- Track what exists now.
- Track where each thing lives at runtime.
- Track whether it is actually player-facing.
- Track what has a real sink versus what is only a source today.
- Track which surfaces have authored images, placeholder art, or code fallbacks.
- Support planning and maintenance rather than player-facing lore.

## Wiki Home Structure

| Section | What it answers | Planning use |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime image and placeholder rules | What image surfaces exist and how fallback behaves | Prevents false "missing art" reports and keeps placeholder surfaces explicit |
| Core resources, processed materials, farming, enemy drops | What items exist, where they live, and whether they matter today | Tracks sink coverage and dead ends |
| Equipment | What gear exists, how it is acquired, and which authored overlays currently ship | Tracks equip-path clarity, current visual coverage, and remaining gaps |
| Source-only, dead, and internal tokens | What should not be mistaken for real backpack items | Prevents maintenance drift and data confusion |
| Enemy chance tables | What enemies currently drop | Keeps balance and source-planning visible |
| Recipe routing reference | What crafting routes exist and where results go | Prevents recipe/data/code drift |
| First-class recipe pages | Station, inputs, raw outputs, result route, and actual result in play | Makes crafting continuity reviewable without digging through station pages |
| Status browser pages | Current-live, planned-data, dead, source-only, and internal slices | Keeps current reference separate from future planning |
| Visual surface index | What art families are covered versus deferred | Tracks image coverage at the system level |
| Rendered item graph | What the current source-to-craft-to-equipment flow looks like | Gives reviewers a real graph instead of raw graph source in static viewers |
| Skills | What perk lanes are live, planned, or groundwork only | Makes the skill-system work queue visible without implying planned lanes are shipped |
| Planned-only data hooks | What is referenced but not implemented | Makes future work visible without pretending it is live |
| Current maintenance priorities | What still needs attention | Turns the page into a live planning surface |

## Image Coverage Dashboard

| Surface family | Live coverage now | Placeholder or fallback used now | Missing or deferred images | Maintenance note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Item icons | Fully covered for all 43 current item ids via `art/generated/items/<id>.png` | Generated 16x16 swatch fallback still exists in `BlockRegistry.item_icon()` | none for current live item ids | Item icons are canonical-only by design; this is stable, not incomplete. |
| Block/world art | Covered for current live blocks | Generated block-texture fallback exists | no live blockers | Variant pools are already live for many blocks. |
| Enemy sprites | Covered for all 6 live enemies | Code-drawn hostile fallback exists | only planned enemy families | No live enemy image gap right now. |
| Equipment icons | No dedicated live backpack-style equipment icon family in use | Text-only equipment panels and procedural equipped visuals | still deferred by design | This is intentionally not the same thing as item-icon coverage. |
| Player gear overlays | 120 authored body-specific PNGs: crude helmet/torso/feet plus three-phase basic-pick, forged-pick, and crude-axe swings across ten bodies | Generic/rig-aware procedural presentation remains for uncovered or unresolved equipment | swords, iron armor, rings, amulet, accessory, plus alignment/refresh hardening | Current coverage is substantial but an intermittent load/refresh presentation defect remains. |
| UI art | Primary 19-asset native HUD kit is live under `art/generated/ui_painted/`; legacy reserved hooks also remain | FQ-21 sliced band, FQ-19 modular construction, and code styles are fallback paths | final polish for primary chrome and framed panels | Runtime values/states remain separate from PNGs by contract. |
| Opening scenes | Eight authored scene pools / ten PNGs are live | Deterministic plotted prologue remains the resilience fallback | optional approved animation/variant expansion | Scene 1 has three frames; the other seven currently use one authored cel each. |
| Backgrounds and back walls | Covered for current live surfaces | Code-drawn sky / silhouette and darkened wall fallback exists | cave/deep-cave families still future | No current maintenance blocker. |

## Status Legend

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Storage | Where the thing actually lives now: inventory, stockpile, equipment slot, world block, UI surrogate icon, or internal token. |
| Player-facing? | `Yes`, `No`, `World-only`, or `UI-only`. This prevents world-state metadata from being mistaken for backpack items. |
| Sink status | `complete` = live source and live downstream use; `source-only` = live source but no meaningful downstream sink yet; `dead` = defined but not obtainable now; `planned` = referenced only by planned systems; `internal` = runtime token, not a real player item. |
| Image ref | The authored runtime image convention or file family currently used. |
| Placeholder / fallback | What the engine shows when authored art is absent. |

## Runtime Image And Placeholder Rules

| Surface | Current authored path | Current state | Placeholder / fallback behavior | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inventory and drop icons | `art/generated/items/<id>.png` | All 43 current item ids have canonical 16x16 PNGs | `BlockRegistry.item_icon()` falls back to a generated 16x16 swatch from `data/items.json` color, or a stable hash-derived hue for unknown ids | Missing item art is not a runtime break, but the fallback should be treated as temporary unless the surface is intentionally abstract. |
| Block/world art | `art/generated/blocks/<id>.png` plus optional `_01.._03` variants | Live and covered | Falls back to generated block texture | Helps separate world blocks from inventory items. |
| Enemy sprites | `art/generated/enemies/<id>.png` plus optional `_01.._03` variants | Live and covered | Falls back to code-drawn hostile shapes | Live enemies are visually safe even if art regresses. |
| Equipment item icons | no live 16x16 dedicated equipment icon family in use | Deferred | Equipment panels stay text-based | Important because equipment ids should not be assumed to have backpack-style icons. |
| Player gear overlays | `art/generated/player_gear/<item_id>_<body_id>.png` and `<tool_id>_<body_id>_swing_<phase>.png` | 120 body-specific crude-armor/tool PNGs live | Body-specific -> generic -> rig-aware procedural fallback | Current unresolved ids and intermittent refresh/alignment are tracked on Known Issues. |
| Primary HUD kit | authored `art/source_templates/hud_dock/` -> runtime `art/generated/ui_painted/` | 19 required native RGBA layers plus contract-v2 `hud_dock_layout.json`, composite preview, and runtime geometry guide live | FQ-21 sliced band -> FQ-19 modular dock -> code styles | Use the HUD Asset Replacement Studio; replacement art is drop-in, new decorative layers are manifest-driven, and new interactive behavior remains code-registered. |
| Legacy UI hooks | `art/generated/ui/<id>.png` | 10 live, 5 deliberate placeholders | Code styles or text where supported | Retained for fallback/reserved consumers rather than primary dock authoring. |
| Opening scenes | `art/generated/opening/<scene_id>_01.png`... | Eight pools / ten PNGs live | Falls back to plotted prologue scenes | Authored cels are preferred without removing deterministic fallback. |

## Visual Surface Index

| Surface family | Current state | Missing or deferred | Planning note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Item icons | Fully covered for all 43 current item ids | none required for current live item ids | Stable and canonical-only by design. |
| Enemy sprites | Covered for all 6 live enemy ids | planned enemy families only | No immediate live-image blocker. |
| Player bodies | Covered for all 10 live body ids plus look variants | planned ancestry bodies only | Safe for current shell and gameplay. |
| Equipment overlays | 120 body-specific PNGs live for crude armor and basic/forged pick + crude axe swings | uncovered equipment families and refresh/alignment hardening | Continue from current coverage; do not regenerate already-authored families without an approved style pass. |
| Equipment item icons | No live consumer | still deferred | Do not mistake this for a bug; the game currently does not use backpack-style equipment icons. |
| UI | Primary native 19-asset HUD kit live; legacy/reserved UI hooks retained | primary chrome polish and framed-panel defect cleanup | Runtime content remains separate; use the HUD Asset Replacement Studio. |
| Opening art | Eight authored scene pools / ten PNGs live | optional approved animation/variant expansion | Plotted fallback remains safe and deterministic. |
| Backdrops and back walls | live and covered for current surfaces | future cave/deep-cave/background families | Not a current blocker. |

## Planned-Only Data Hooks

These are intentionally separated from live content. They are not implemented current mechanics.

| Item id | Status | Referenced by | Chance | Why it matters | Recommended first implementation sink |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `antlers` | planned, not implemented | Hollow Stag | 5% | rare prestige material hook | trophy, ritual focus, high-tier trade |
| `clay` | planned, not implemented | Mudling | 60% | construction/material branch hook | bricks, pottery, furnace upgrade |
| `forged_seal` | planned, not implemented | False Taxman | 30% | economy/politics hook | civic quest or treasury sink |
| `fungal_thread` | planned, not implemented | Sporekin | 35% | cave cloth/alchemy hook | wraps, filters, attunement cloth |
| `fuse_cord` | planned, not implemented | Raider Sapper | 35% | trap/explosive hook | demolition or trap recipes |
| `glow_gland` | planned, not implemented | Lantern Leech | 45% | advanced light hook | cave lamp or alchemy light |
| `hide` | planned, not implemented | Burrow Maw; Hollow Stag | 50%; 25% | stronger leather branch hook | medium armor or packs |
| `mud` | planned, not implemented | Mudling | 30% | low-tier construction hook | clay prep or farming amendment |
| `oil` | planned, not implemented | Lantern Leech | 55% | light/fuel hook | lantern fuel or fire weapons |
| `picks` | planned, not implemented | Raider Sapper | 50% | salvage/tool hook | tool repair or iron salvage |
| `reed_fiber` | planned, not implemented | Mudling | 10% | weaving/rope hook | rope, nets, matting |
| `spores` | planned, not implemented | Sporekin | 65% | fungal/alchemy hook | medicine, poison, farming catalyst |
| `stone_plates` | planned, not implemented | Stoneback Beetle | 80% | heavy armor/fortification hook | armor, barricade plating |
| `teeth` | planned, not implemented | Burrow Maw | 50% | combat trophy hook | dagger, charm, trophy |
| `venison` | planned, not implemented | Hollow Stag | 70% | premium food hook | feast or trade good |
| `venom` | planned, not implemented | Ash Wasp | 5% | poison/alchemy hook | toxin, trap, advanced craft |
| `wax` | planned, not implemented | Ash Wasp | 60% | candle/light hook | candles, seals, polish |
| `wings` | planned, not implemented | Ash Wasp | 35% | light craft/alchemy hook | fletching or charm craft |

## Current Maintenance Priorities

| Priority | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Add first real sinks for live enemy drops | The largest cluster of current `source-only` items is combat loot. |
| Add first downstream sinks for `silver_ingot`, `bronze_ingot`, and `crystal` | Metallurgy and attunement progression currently stop early. |
| Decide whether `ring_band` and `amulet_focus` should stay dead or become near-term goals | They are already defined and create obvious planning pressure. |
| Decide whether any world-only metadata items should remain non-inventory forever | `grass`, `farm_soil`, `crop_seedling`, `crop_ripe`, and `berry_bush` are easy to misunderstand without a deliberate policy. |
| Harden authored `player_gear` refresh/alignment and extend only uncovered equipment families | Crude armor and three tool families already have 120 PNGs; the active problem is reliable presentation and polished motion, not an empty asset directory. |
| Replace provisional HUD chrome through the native kit contract | Geometry and runtime separation are stabilized; the remaining work is asset and framed-panel polish with screenshot review. |

## Notes

- No mechanics were changed to produce this wiki.
- Current sink recommendations are proposals only and are not live gameplay behavior.
- Future-sink ideas are centralized in `planned_data.md`; strict current item pages should describe current sources, current uses, and current limitations without embedding planning bullets.
